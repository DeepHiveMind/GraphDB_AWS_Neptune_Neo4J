# GraphDB_AWS_Neptune_Neo4J

We live in a connected world! There are no isolated pieces of information, but rich, connected domains all around us.

*Welcome to the Real world of System-Of-Engagements*

**Welcome to world of GraphDB!!**


- Graph databases **natively embraces relationships**. 
- While other databases compute **relationships at query time** through **expensive JOIN operations**, a Graph database stores **connections alongside the data** in the model.
- The Property Graph Model: A *Node-Edges-Properties model* to *organize Domain Data and their inherent relationships*. A quick glimpse of Property Graph Model-

- Independent of the total size of your dataset, graph databases excel at managing highly-connected data and complex queries.
- Graph DB is used for very many types of Use Cases (*not* just for *Social Graph* or *Recommendation engine*), such as 
	- **MASTER DATA MANAGEMENT**
	- **GRAPH BASED SEARCH**
	- **REAL TIME RECOMMENDATIONS**
	- **SOCIAL NETWORK**
	- **FRAUD DETECTION**
	- **Google Maps and Routes APIs**
	- **NETWORK & IT-OPERATIONS**
	- **IDENTITY & ACCESS MANAGEMENT**
	- **System-Of-Engagements**

- Graph DB Offers over other RDMBS as well as NOSQL DBs
	- Intuitiveness
	- Speed
	- Agility
**graphs are the most natural way to model data in the real world.**
