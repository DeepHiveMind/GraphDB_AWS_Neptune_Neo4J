**Welcome to world of GraphDB!!**

- Graph databases **natively embraces relationships**. 
- While other databases compute **relationships at query time** through **expensive JOIN operations**, a Graph database stores **connections alongside the data** in the model.
- Independent of the total size of your dataset, graph databases excel at managing highly-connected data and complex queries.
- The Property Graph Model: A *Node-Edges-Properties model* to *organize Domain Data and their inherent relationships*. A quick glimpse of Property Graph Model-
